A DRUPAL THEME BUILT FROM SCRATCH BASED ON ZEN STARTER KIT
----------------------
<b>CUSTOMER</b>: CTV Channel, Belarus, Minsk.

Our TV company's English website http://en.ctv.by needed a new theme and working as a translator I saw it better than anyone else. 

Need I say how glad I was when I learned my offer to rebuild the site was accepted by the company?

I was looking for experience and in 1.5 months created this nice theme for the site.

To build this theme I had to learn Drupal 7 theming and backend from scratch. My prior experience with Wordpress theming helped me too.

I used SASS, JS, jQuery, Gulp and a bit of PHP to craft this theme.
